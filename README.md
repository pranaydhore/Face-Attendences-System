# Face-Attendences-System
This Python-based attendance system uses OpenCV and face recognition technology to automatically log attendance. The system detects faces from a live webcam feed using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier. Once a face is detected, it generates a unique Face ID by hashing the cropped face image using SHA-256.
